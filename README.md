# IIT-AI-ML-Notebooks
A curated set of notebooks developed during my IIT course, covering fundamental concepts, coding practice, and applied machine learning experiments.

File: Titanic_DT.ipynb

This notebook explores the Titanic dataset and builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict passenger survival. It includes a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, covering everything from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

Key Steps Covered

Dataset loading and exploration using Seaborn and Pandas

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Handling missing values (Age, Embarked, Deck)

Descriptive statistics and distribution checks

Feature engineering and dataset preparation

Train–test split for model evaluation

Decision Tree model training using DecisionTreeClassifier

Model evaluation (accuracy score, classification report, confusion matrix)

Decision tree visualization using plot_tree

Outcome

This notebook demonstrates how to clean a real dataset and train a simple, interpretable machine learning model. It acts as a solid starting point for building more advanced models in future notebooks.
